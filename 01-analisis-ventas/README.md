# 📊 Project 1 — Sales Analytics · TechSell S.A.

## Business Problem
A technology company needed visibility into its sales performance to drive better commercial decision-making. The management team lacked clear insights regarding which regions, products, and sales representatives were generating the highest revenue.

## Solution
An exploratory data analysis (EDA) of 2 years of transactional sales data (2023–2024), uncovering key business metrics across regions, product lines, and sales reps, synthesized into an interactive executive dashboard.

## Tech Stack
- **SQL** — Data exploration, filtering, and analytical queries
- **Power BI** — Data modeling, DAX measures, and interactive reporting

## Dataset Overview
Relational database consisting of 5 tables · 300 orders · 776 order details · Period: January 2023 – December 2024

## Methodology & Process

### SQL — Exploration & Data Analysis
- Loaded and structured 5 relational tables into SQL.
- Wrote 8 analytical queries covering: products per category, total sales by region, regional sales by category, top 5 products, churned/canceled orders, average order value (AOV), top-performing sales representatives, and monthly sales trends.
- Filtered order statuses to isolate completed sales transactions for accurate financial metrics.

### Power BI — Data Modeling & Visualization
- Connected Excel data source to Power BI Desktop.
- Designed a **Star Schema** relational model connecting all 5 tables.
- Created 5 core DAX measures: *Total Revenue*, *Completed Sales*, *Total Orders*, *Average Order Value (AOV)*, and *Cancellation Rate*.
- Built a single-page executive dashboard featuring key KPIs, monthly revenue trends, regional distribution, and top 5 products by revenue.
- Implemented interactive slicers enabling seamless filtering by year (2023 / 2024).

## Executive Summary & KPIs (Completed Orders · 2023–2024)
- **Total Revenue:** $1.60M
- **Total Orders:** 300
- **Average Order Value (AOV):** $5.32K
- **Cancellation Rate:** 6.00%

## Key Findings
* **Top Region:** The **South** region generated the highest revenue ($518K), followed by the **North** region ($366K).
* **Best-Selling Product:** **Laptop Pro 15** leads total product revenue with $530K.
* **Top Sales Rep:** **Carlos López** ranks #1 in sales volume ($290K).
* **Highest Ticket Segment:** **Retail** holds the highest average order value by customer segment ($9,681).
* **Risk Alert:** **FastGrow Startup** recorded the highest number of canceled orders (4 cancellations).
* **Seasonality:** The dashboard enables side-by-side monthly sales trend comparisons between 2023 and 2024.

## Actionable Recommendations
- **Scale Winning Strategies:** Investigate operational and commercial dynamics in the **South region** to replicate its sales playbook across lower-performing territories.
- **Segment Targeting:** Prioritize marketing and sales campaigns toward the **Retail segment** to capitalize on its high ticket size.
- **Customer Retention:** Closely monitor **FastGrow Startup** to identify root causes behind their frequent order cancellations and mitigate further revenue loss.
